# Olympic Medal Predictions (Winter)
This project estimates a Tobit model using 2014/2018/2022 Winter Olympics data and generates predicted medal counts for 2026. It then compares predictions to actual 2026 medals to compute over/under performance gaps.

## How to run
1. Open the R script: `2026prediction.R`
2. Make sure the CSV files are in the same folder (or update file paths)
3. Run the script top to bottom.

## Output
Creates predicted medals, rescales totals to match medals available, and computes a gap (actual - predicted).
